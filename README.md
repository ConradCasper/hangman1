-Project Description:
This is a hangman game I created for my first project at GA. As the user selects letters to guess the mystery word, a body part will appear or a letter will appear depending on if the letter is in the word or not. Guess the word correctly and a message will appear saying "you won!." Make 6 incorrect guesses and a message will pop up saying "you lost." Have fun playing!
